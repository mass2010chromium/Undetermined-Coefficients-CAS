# Undetermined-Coefficients-CAS
Method of undetermined coefficients differential equation solver

Very minimal computer algebra system - hardcoded derivatives for polynomial, exponential, sin/cos terms - supports addition and multiplication of terms with a single variable

Solves second order differential equations of form:
Ay'' + By' + Cy = Pn * e^(Dx) * sin(Ex)
